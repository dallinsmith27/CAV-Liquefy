# Joiner Ridge

The Joiner Ridge source zone logic tree as a whole has the ID: `40000`.

The Joiner Ridge source zone was introduced for the 2023 Conterminous U.S. NSHM.
The source zone was defined by Jessica Thompson Jobe, based on recent work by
Price et al. (2019) and Ward et al. (2017).


The zone is modeled with vertical strike-slip faults parallel to the southeast/northwest axis of the
zone polygon (i.e., strike = 350 degrees).


The Mmax distribution was informed by Price et al. (2019) and Ward et al. (2017).

The total rate in the zone was based on estimated slip rates from Price et al. (2019) 
and Ward et al. (2017).  

|Weight| Rate     |

| 0.30 | 7.51E-04 |                   
| 0.20 | 3.17E-04 |

For the 2023 NSHM, we give this source a weight of 0.5.
