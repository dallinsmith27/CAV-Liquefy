## New Madrid Seismic Zone

Starting with the 2014 update, the NSHM considered two alternative source representations, one similar to prior USGS New Madrid source models, and the other derived from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Central and Eastern United States seismic source characterization for nuclear (SSCn) facilities.
