# Central Virginia

The Central Virginia source zone logic tree as a whole has the ID: `10000`.

The Central Virginia source zone was introduced for the 2023 Conterminous U.S. NSHM.
The source zone was defined by Jessica Thompson Jobe, based on recent work by
Pazzaglia et al (2021) and Tuttle et al. (2021). 


The zone has two alternative geometries; `local` [10001] and `regional` [10002]. Each zone
is modeled with vertical strike-slip faults parallel to the southwest/northeast axis of the
zone polygons (i.e., strike = 42 degrees).


The Mmax distribution was informed by Tuttle et al. (2021), who note the apparent lack of
widespread liquefaction features and interpreted this as evidence that an earthquake of M>7
has not occurred in the zone during the past 10,000 years, though an earthquake in the M6-7
range was not ruled out (Obermeier and McNulty, 1998;â€¯Dominion, 2004).

For rate, followed CEUS SSCn (2012) method: Duration is uniformly distributed between 
1800 and 2800 years. Likelihood calculation gives: 

|Weight | Rate     |
|:-----:|:--------:|
| 0.101 | 2.3E-03  |                    
| 0.244 | 1.3E-03  |                  
| 0.310 | 7.5E-04  |                   
| 0.244 | 3.9E-04  |
| 0.101 | 1.4E-04  |

For the 2023 NSHM, we give this source a weight of 0.5.
