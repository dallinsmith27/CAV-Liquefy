# Crowley's Ridge (South)

The Crowley's Ridge (South) source zone logic tree as a whole has the ID: `20000`.

The Crowley's Ridge (South) source zone was introduced for the 2023 Conterminous U.S. NSHM.
The source zone was defined by Jessica Thompson Jobe, based on recent work by
Thompson Jobe et al. (2020).


The zone is modeled with vertical strike-slip faults parallel to the southwest/northeast axis of the
zone polygon (i.e., strike = 5 degrees).

The Mmax distribution was informed by Thompson Jobe et al. (2020).

The total rate in the zone was based on estimated slip rates from Thompson Jobe et al. (2020).
