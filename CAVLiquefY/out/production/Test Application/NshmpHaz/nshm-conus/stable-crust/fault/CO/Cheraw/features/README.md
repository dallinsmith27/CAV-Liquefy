## Cheraw Fault

#### USGS
* ID: `2180`
* Old name: `Cheraw USGS`
* Original file: `CEUScm2014.in`
* Comments: The location of the Cheraw source is generalized from Crone and others (1997); the source dips to the northwest and is assigned a default 60° dip for normal sources. The assigned geologic slip rate is based on trenching investigations (Crone and others, 1997) that document three surface-rupturing earthquakes in the past 25 k.y. Vertical displacement during the last two events include 1.1–1.6 m in the penultimate earthquake and 0.5–1.1 m in the most recent event totaling 1.6–2.7 m of vertical offset over the past 12–17 k.y. Recurrence intervals on the Cheraw fault may be bimodal, with clusters of comparatively short intervals alternating with much longer intervals; the assigned maximum magnitude and assigned geologic slip rate for this fault source yield annual rates for end-to-end rupture of the source that are compatible with the recent geologic record. Faults east of the Rocky Mountains were not modeled using inversion of geologic and geodetic data (Bird, 2014; Zeng and Shen, 2014).
