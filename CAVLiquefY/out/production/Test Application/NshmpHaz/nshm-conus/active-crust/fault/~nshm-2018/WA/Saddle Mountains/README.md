# Saddle Mountains

The Saddle Mountains fault zone includes a geologic branch with a Holocene slip rate that
gets 25% weight. Although this branch is replicated cross all deformation models, the geodetic
branches have the same rate on both.

Both saddle Mountains branches have the same feature geometry and ID but different nested
MFDs. The source tree ID is therefore the same as the feature ID: `2807`
