# West Valley Fault

The West Valley fault is antithetic to the Salt Lake City section of the Wasatch fault. On the
`geologic` branch. It is modeled using different widths corresponding to the three fault dip
variants applied to normal faults in the Western U.S. paired with each of the three dip variants
for the Wasatch (9 different fault surfaces in total). This complexity necessitates using a
logic-tree of rupture-sets with explicitely defined MFDs and dip variant branches.
