# Conterminous U.S. Seismicity Catalogs

For each update of the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) National Seismic Hazard Model (NSHM),
seismicity catalogs (full and declustered) are developed as input to the smoothed 
seismicity model. Catalogs are developed separately for the central and eastern U.S.
(CEUS) and western U.S. (WUS) due to different input catalogs as well as magnitude 
conversions. 

Development of the seismicity catalogs include:

- reformatting and combining pre-existing input catalogs,
- deleting duplicates, explosions, and mining-related events,
- flagging induced events in the CEUS, and
- delivering a final uniform moment magnitude catalog for further processing 
(i.e., declustering).

[Mueller (2019)][1] outlines the full set of catalog processing steps in further detail.
