# Eastern Rift Margin (South) Source Zone

The Eastern Rift Margin (South) fault logic tree as a whole has the ID: `3809`.

In the 2014/2018 NSHM update, this source was modeled as a zone source.

For the 2023 NSHM update, this source is now modeled as a fault source. Geometry of fault
provided by J. Thompson Jobe in the fall of 2021. The fault length for the ERM-S rupture 
scenario is slightly increased from CEUS SSCn (2012) based on revised intersection with the Reelfoot 
fault from Delano et al. (2021). Fault length is 102 km.  

The fault either ruptures to the southwest (Crittenden County) or the southeast (Meeman-Shelby):

Eastern Rift Margin (South) [`3802`]
Eastern Rift Margin (South Extension) [`3803`]
Crittenden County [`3806`]

or

Eastern Rift Margin (South) [`3802`]
Meeman-Shelby [`3804`]


Mmax distribution is unchanged from 2014/2018 NSHM update (Table H-5.6-1).

Rate data remain unchanged from 2014/2018 NSHM update, however, we now use the full
CEUS SSCn (2012) tables (H-5.6-3, H-5.6-4, and H-5.6-5) for additional epistemic uncertainty.
