## Cheraw

The following sections are from hazfaults_2014 Postgres table. We are not including these fields in initial publication of nshm-fault-sections but keeping a record of them here for future review.

#### Slip Rate Comments
The minimum slip rate represents an average long-term slip rate on the Cheraw fault and would include the effect of quiescent periods. The best estimate of a long-term slip rate is less than or equal to 0.007 mm/yr based on a cumulative offset of about 8 m on the 1.2 Ma Rocky Flats Alluvium. The maximum late Quaternary slip rate of which the fault is capable could be estimated from the larger offset (1.1 m) of the most recent earthquake, which relieved stress that had accumulated in 4 k.y.

#### Change Comments
LENGTH ~44.2

NOTE: sense of slip should be normal-fix rake too--changes made 3/28/06 to be same as 2nd record from 2002

Probability of activity changed from 0.5 to 1 on 1/30/2007. KH and RW cannot identify source of 0.5 value; thus, it is considered an error in the record.
