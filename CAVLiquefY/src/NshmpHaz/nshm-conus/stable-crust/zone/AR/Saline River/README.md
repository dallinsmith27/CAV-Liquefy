# Saline River

The Saline River source zone logic tree as a whole has the ID: `50000`.

The Saline River source zone was introduced for the 2023 Conterminous U.S. NSHM.
The source zone was defined by Jessica Thompson Jobe, based on recent work by
Cox et al. (2012; 2013; 2014).

The zone is modeled with vertical strike-slip faults parallel to the northwest/southeast axis of the
zone polygon (i.e., strike = 290 degrees).

The Mmax distribution was informed by Cox et al. (2012; 2013; 2014).

For rate, followed CEUS SSCn (2012) method: Duration is uniformly distributed between 
322 and 5100 years. Likelihood calculation gives: 

|Weight | Rate     |
|:-----:|:--------:|
| 0.101 | 4.8E-03  |                    
| 0.244 | 1.5E-03  |                  
| 0.310 | 6.8E-04  |                   
| 0.244 | 3.1E-04  |
| 0.101 | 1.0E-04  |

For the 2023 NSHM, we give this source a weight of 0.5.
